# house-price-regression

I trained many regression algorithms on a kaggle housing dataset in order to find the most accurate model.

If you want to run the the models on your own, you will have to run Notebook.ipynb in Google Colab and make sure train.csv is in the same parent folder as the notebook. Then, change the file path to the data to ensure it is correct, after the code should run!
